# Calculate-Area-and-perimeter-of-rectangle-triangle-or-circle
Welcome to the Shape Calculator Programs repository! This project contains three Python programs designed to help you calculate the perimeter, area, and circumference of different geometric shapes including rectangles, triangles, circles, and squares. Each program prompts the user to input the specific dimensions and then computes and returns the correct values.

Description This repository includes the following programs:

Rectangle Area and Perimeter Calculator: Calculates the perimeter and area of rectangles and squares. Triangle Perimeter Calculator: Computes the Perimeter of triangles. Circumference Calculator: Determines the circumference of circles. Features User Input: Each program asks the user to input the necessary dimensions for the specific shape (e.g., side lengths, base and height, radius). Accurate Calculations: Provides precise calculations for perimeter, area, and circumference based on the user-provided dimensions. Clear Output: Displays the calculated values in a clear and easy-to-understand format. Shapes Supported Rectangles: Input length and width to calculate the perimeter and area. Triangles: Input the sides for perimeter, base and height for area. Circles: Input the radius to calculate the area and circumference. Squares: Input the side length to calculate the perimeter and area. Getting Started Clone the repository and run each program individually to perform the desired calculations. Detailed instructions and examples are included to guide you through the process.

Contributions We welcome contributions to enhance these programs! Feel free to fork the repository, improve the code, and submit pull requests. Suggestions for additional features or improvements are also appreciated.

This description provides a concise and informative overview of the project, highlighting the key features and functionality of each Python program.
